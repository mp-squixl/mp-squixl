## UM SQUiXL example code enhanced

FONTS
The example microptyon code provided by UM, initially at least, only uses the standard framebuffer text font.  
This framebuffer font cannot be changed and its 8x8 pixels.  Its quite miniscule for such a nice large screen. 

So first up is an example of using alternative fonts.
